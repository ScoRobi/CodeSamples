Hello,

To execute the program, simply run the executable jar file with an argument 
for the location of your desired output XML file.

>>Example: palindrome.jar ./output.xml

Improvements that could be made:
	-Better handling/checking of an output directory
	-Better XML parsing library (DOM is somewhat intensive)
	-Use of a stack instead of recursion to avoid possible stack overflow

Thank you and please contact me if you have any questions!
